# odin-landing-page-2
The Odin Project landing page.
This is simple project on HTML and CSS. 
Learned how to use display: flex for the whole web page as well as how to do div containers as well as divs within divs.
Make sure to do a div container to center all of it and add padding to div container
Then if you have left or right side content divs to put them in one div within the container to adjust even more.
